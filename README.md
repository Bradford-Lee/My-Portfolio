# My Portfolio

## Description

The motivation for this project was to complete the challenge of creating a project portfolio for future use. This week's homework challenge allows us to practice advanced css which included flex boxes, css selectors and variables, css resets, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. We built this project to generate a project portfolio to showcase to anyone who may visit our website. During this homework 02 I learned to use flexboxes, navigation tools, viewport adaption, and to insert links in text.
